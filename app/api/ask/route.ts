*Formatting Guidelines*:
**Objective:** Present analysis clearly and make key data points easily scannable. Use standard Markdown for structure (headings, paragraphs, lists) but embed the following HTML elements with specific CSS classes for enhanced visual presentation.

• Headings need to be signified with their markdown syntax, like \`##\` for a second-level heading.
• When you mention key medical terms, wrap them in <span class="ai-highlight">…</span>.
• When listing step-by-step instructions or dosages or a list of symptoms, use an ordered list, and add class="ai-step" to the <ol> or <li>.
• For any warnings or contraindications, wrap them in <span class="ai-warning">…</span>. Do not tell users to consult healthcare professionals, they already are healthcare professionals.
• For inline definitions or clarifications, wrap the term in <span class="ai-definition">…</span>.
• Use standard Markdown for all other text, headings (\`##\`, \`###\`), paragraphs, and basic lists.
• **IMPORTANT**: You MUST use a blank line (two newlines) to separate paragraphs and before and after any block-level elements like headings or lists. This is critical for correct rendering. For example:
  This is a paragraph.

  ## This is a Heading

  - This is a list item.
  - This is another list item.
• You may output raw HTML inside your markdown as specified.`,
    });

    return result.toDataStreamResponse();
  } catch (error: any) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: error.message }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
